# uber clone 

Uber Clone: Designed and built a web-based Uber clone. The frontend was developed using Vue.js and Tailwind CSS, which allowed for easy customisation and responsive design - resulting in a consistent replication of the signature Uber styling. The backend utilises Node.js, Express and Axios in order to create a robust but simple API capable of facilitating the apps origin/destination and location autocomplete. Integration of Google Maps API provides accurate geolocation services, real-time location tracking, directions and estimated arrival times. https://github.com/n-igbokwe/uber
